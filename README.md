# Collections Exercise

## Intention

This program intends to remove strings containing 'oggy' from a list of strings as I don't like cockroaches.

## Method

1. Create an iterator object over the arraylist of strings (`names`).
2. Iterate over the iterator object to get each string in the arraylist.
3. Check if "oggy" is present in each string.
4. if yes, then remove that element from array list.
